			<p>The story in Wuthering Waves is set after the calamity known as the "Calament" razed the world of almost all human life. Desperate to survive, the survivors forged uneasy alliances to rebuild some semblance of civilization from its ruins. Among their efforts to protect themselves came the Resonators, humans with unique compositions due to being fused with Wutherons, who can fight against the monstrosities that spawned along with the Calament. You take on the role of a mysterious newcomer simply known as the "Rover." Due to the circumstances of your arrival, the Resonators end up keeping you closely monitored. And gradually, as you connect with the world around you, the secrets behind your past and the world reveal themselves.</p>
